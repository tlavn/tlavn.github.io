                                <br>
                                For the century before Johnson's Dictionary 
                                was published in | 775, there had been 
                                concern about the state of the English 
                                language. There was no standard way of 
                                speaking or writing and no agreement as to 
                                the best way of bringing some order to the 
                                chaos of English spelling, Dr Johnson 
                                provided the solution.
                                <br><br>
                                There had, of course, been dictionaries in the 
                                past, the first of these being a little book of 
                                some 120 pages, compiled by a certain 
                                Robert Cawdray, published in 1604 under 
                                the title A Table Alphabetical 'of hard usuall 
                                English wordes’. Like the various 
                                dictionaries that came after it during the 
                                seventeenth century, Cawdray's tended to 
                                concentrate on ‘scholarly’ words; one 
                                function of the dictionary was to enable its 
                                student to convey an impression of fine 
                                learning.
                                <br><br>
                                Beyond the practical need to make order out 
                                of chaos, the rise of dictionaries is associated 
                                with the rise of the English middle class, who 
                                were anxious to define and circumscribe the 
                                various worlds to conquer — lexical as well 
                                as social and commercial, It is highly 
                                appropriate that Dr Samuel Johnson, the 
                                very model of an eighteenth-century literary 
                                man, as famous in his own time as in ours, 
                                should have published his Dictionary at the 
                                very beginning of the heyday of the middle 
                                class.
                                <br><br>
                                Johnson was a poet and critic who raised 
                                common sense to the heights of genius. His 
                                approach to the problems that had worried 
                                writers throughout the late seventeenth and 
                                early eighteenth centuries was intensely 
                                practical. Up until his time, the task of 
                                producing a dictionary on such a large scale 
                                had seemed impossible without the 
                                establishment of an academy to make 
                                decisions about right and wrong usage.
                                Johnson decided he did not need an academy 
                                to settle arguments about language; he 
                                would write a dictionary himself; and he would do it single-handed. Johnson signed 
                                the contract for the Dictionary with the 
                                bookseller Robert Dosley at a breakfast held 
                                at the Golden Anchor Inn near Holborn Bar 
                                on 18 June 1764. He was to be paid £1,575 in 
                                instalments, and from this he took money to
                                rent 17 Gough Square, in which he set up his 
                                ‘dictionary workshop’.
                                <br><br>
                                ames Boswell, his biographer, described the 
                                garret where Johnson worked as ‘fitted up 
                                like a counting house’ with a long desk 
                                running down the middle at which the 
                                copying clerks would work standing up. 
                                Johnson himself was stationed on a rickety 
                                chair at an ‘old crazy deal table’ surrounded 
                                by a chaos of borrowed books. He was also 
                                helped by six assistants, two of whom died 
                                whilst the Dictionary was still in 
                                preparation.
                                <br><br>
                                The work was immense; filling about eighty 
                                large notebooks (and without a library to 
                                hand), Johnson wrote the definitions of over 
                                40,000 words, and illustrated their many 
                                meanings with some 14.000 quotations 
                                drawn from English writing on every 
                                subject, from the Elizabethans to his own 
                                time. He did not expect to achieve complete 
                                originality. Working to a deadline, he had to 
                                draw on the best of all previous dictionaries, 
                                and to make his work one of heroic 
                                synthesis. In fact, it was very much more. 
                                Unlike his predecessors, Johnson treated 
                                English very practically, as a living language, 
                                with many different shades of meaning, He 
                                adopted his definitions on the principle of 
                                English common law — according to 
                                precedent. After its publication, his 
                                Dictionary was not seriously rivalled for 
                                over a century,
                                <br><br>
                                After many vicissitudes the Dictionary was 
                                finally published on 15 April 1775. It was 
                                instantly recognised as a landmark 
                                throughout Europe. ‘This very noble work; 
                                wrote the leading Italian lexicographer ‘will 
                                be a perpetual monument of Fame to the Author, an Honour to his own Country in 
                                particular, and a general Benefit to the 
                                republic of Letters throughout Europe.’ The 
                                fact that Johnson had taken on the 
                                Academies of Europe and matched them 
                                (everyone knew that forty French academics 
                                had taken forty years to produce the first

                                <br>
                                <span class="number">A</span> A few years ago, in one of the most fascinating and disturbing experiments in behavioural 
                                psychology, Stanley Milgram of Yale University tested 40 subjects from all walks of life for 
                                their willingness to obey instructions given by a ‘leader’ in a situation in which the subjects 
                                might feel a personal distaste for the actions they were called upon to perform. Specifically, 
                                Milgram told each volunteer 'teacher-subject’ that the experiment was in the noble cause of 
                                education, and was designed to test whether or not punishing pupils for their mistakes 
                                would have 2 positive effect on the pupils’ ability to learn.

                                <br><br>
                                <span class="number">B</span> Milgram's experimental set-up involved placing the teacher-subject before a panel of thirty 
                                switches with labels ranging from ‘15 volts of electricity (slight shock)’ to ‘450 volts (danger 
                                — severe shock)’ in steps of 15 volts each. The teacher-subject was told that whenever the 
                                pupil gave the wrong answer to a question, a shock was to be administered, beginning at the 
                                lowest level and increasing in severity with each successive wrong answer. The supposed 
                                ‘pupil’ was in reality an actor hired by Milgram to simulate receiving the shocks by emitting 
                                a spectrum of groans, screams and writhings together with an assortment of statements and 
                                expletives denouncing both the experiment and the experimenter. Milgram told the teacher-subject to ignore the reactions of the pupil, and to administer whatever level of shock was 
                                called for, as per the rule governing the experimental situation of the moment.

                                <br><br>
                                <span class="number">C</span> As the experiment unfolded, the pupil would deliberately give the wrong answers to 
                                questions posed by the teacher, thereby bringing on various electrical punishments, even up 
                                to the danger level of 300 volts and beyond. Many of the teacher-subjects balked at 
                                administering the higher levels of punishment, and turned to Milgram with questioning 
                                looks and/or complaints about continuing the experiment. In these situations, Milgram 
                                calmly explained that the teacher-subject was to ignore the pupil's cries for mercy and carry 
                                on with the experiment. If the subject was still reluctant to proceed, Milgram said that it was 
                                important for the sake of the experiment that the procedure be followed through to the end. 
                                His final argument was, ‘You have no other choice. You must go on.' What Milgram was trying 
                                to discover was the number of teacher-subjects who would be willing to administer the 
                                highest levels of shock, even in the face of strong personal and moral revulsion against the 
                                rules and conditions of the experiment.

                                <br><br>
                                <span class="number">D</span> Prior to carrying out the experiment, Milgram explained his idea to a group of 39 
                                psychiatrists and asked them to predict the average percentage of people in an ordinary 
                                population who would be willing to administer the highest shock level of 450 volts. The 
                                overwhelming consensus was that virtually all the teacher-subjects would refuse to obey 
                                the experimenter. The psychiatrists felt that ‘most subjects would not go beyond 150 volts’ 
                                and they further anticipated that only four per cent would go up to 300 volts. Reading
                                Furthermore, they thought that only a lunatic fringe of about one in 1,000 would give the 
                                highest shock of 450 volts.

                                <br><br>
                                <span class="number">E</span> What were the actual results? Well, over 60 per cent of the teacher-subjects continued to 
                                obey Milgram up to the 460-volt limit! In repetitions of the experiment in other countries, 
                                the percentage of obedient teacher-subjects was even higher, reaching 85 per cent in one 
                                country. How can we possibly account for this vast discrepancy between what calm, rational, 
                                knowledgeable people predict in the comfort of their study and what pressured, flustered, 
                                but cooperative ‘teachers’ actually do in the laboratory of real life?

                                <br><br>
                                <span class="number">F</span> One's first inclination might be to argue that there must be some sort of built-in animal 
                                aggression instinct that was activated by the experiment, and that Milgram’s teacher - subjects were just following a genetic need to discharge this pent-up primal urge onto the 
                                pupil by administering the electrical shock. A modern hard-core socio-biologist might even 
                                go so far as to claim that this aggressive instinct evolved as an advantageous trait, having 
                                been of survival value to our ancestors in their struggle against the hardships of life on the 
                                plains and in the caves, ultimately finding its way into our genetic make-up as a remnant of 
                                Our ancient animal ways.

                                <br><br>
                                <span class="number">G</span> An alternative to this notion of genetic programming is to see the teacher-subjects' actions 
                                as a result of the social environment under which the experiment was carried out. As 
                                Milgram himself pointed out, 'Most subjects in the experiment see their behaviour in a larger 
                                context that is benevolent and useful to society - the pursuit of scientific truth. The 
                                psychological laboratory has a strong claim to legitimacy and evokes trust and confidence 
                                in those who perform there. An action such as shocking a victim, which in isolation appears 
                                evil, acquires a completely different meaning when placed in this setting.’

                                <br><br>
                                <span class="number">H</span> Thus, in this explanation the subject merges his unique personality and personal and moral
                                code with that of larger institutional structures, surrendering individual properties like 
                                loyalty, self-sacrifice and discipline to the service of malevolent systems of authority.
                                
                                <br><br>
                                <span class="number">I</span> Here we have two radically different explanations for why so many teacher-subjects were 
                                willing to forgo their sense of personal responsibility for the sake of an institutional 
                                authority figure. The problem for biologists, psychologists and anthropologists is to sort out 
                                which of these two polar explanations is more plausible. This, in essence, is the problem of 
                                modern sociobiology — to discover the degree to which hard-wired genetic programming 
                                dictates, or at least strongly biases, the interaction of animals and humans with their 
                                environment, that is, their behaviour. Put another way, sociobiology is concerned with 
                                elucidating the biological basis of all behaviour.

                                <br>
                                For many environmentalists, the world seems to be getting worse. They have developed a hit-list of our main fears; that natural resources are running out; that the population is ever 
                                growing, leaving less and less to eat; that species are becoming extinct in vast numbers, and 
                                that the planet's air and water are becoming ever more polluted.

                                <br><br>
                                But a quick look at the facts shows a different picture. First, energy and other natural 
                                resources have become more abundant, not less so, since the book ‘The Limits to Growth’ was 
                                published in 1972 by a group of scientists. Second, more food is now produced per head of 
                                the world’s population than at any time in history. Fewer people are starving. Third, although 
                                species are indeed becoming extinct, only about 0.7% of them are expected to disappear in 
                                the next 50 years, not 25-50%, as has so often been predicted. And finally, most forms of 
                                environmental pollution either appear to have been exaggerated, or are transient —
                                associated with the early phases of industrialisation and therefore best cured not by 
                                restricting economic growth, but by accelerating it. One form of pollution — the release of 
                                greenhouse gases that causes global warming — does appear to be a phenomenon that is 
                                going to extend well into our future, but its total impact is unlikely to pose a devastating 
                                problem. A bigger problem may well turn out to be an inappropriate response to it.


                                <br><br>
                                Yet opinion polls suggest that many people nurture the belief that environmental standards 
                                are declining and four factors seem to cause this disjunction between perception and reality.


                                <br><br>
                                One is the lopsidedness built into scientific research. Scientific funding goes mainly to areas 
                                with many problems. That may be wise policy, but it will also create an impression that many 
                                more potential problems exist than is the case.

                                <br><br>
                                Secondly, environmental groups need to be noticed by the mass media. They also need to keep 
                                the money rolling in. Understandably, perhaps, they sometimes overstate their arguments. In 
                                1997, for example, the World Wide Fund for Nature issued a press release entitled: ‘Two 
                                thirds of the world’s forests lost forever’. The truth turns out to be nearer 20%.


                                <br><br>
                                Though these groups are run overwhelmingly by selfless folk, they nevertheless share many 
                                of the characteristics of other lobby groups. That would matter less if people applied the same 
                                degree of scepticism to environmental lobbying as they do to lobby groups in other fields. A 
                                trade organisation arguing for, say, weaker pollution controls is instantly seen as self-interested. Yet a green organisation opposing such a weakening is seen as altruistic, even if 
                                an impartial view of the controls in question might suggest they are doing more harm than 
                                good.

                                <br><br>
                                A third source of confusion is the attitude of the media. People are clearly more curious about 
                                bad news than good. Newspapers and broadcasters are there to provide what the public 
                                wants. That, however, can lead to significant distortions of perception. An example was 
                                America’s encounter with El Nino in 1997 and 1998. This climatic phenomenon was accused 
                                of wrecking tourism, causing allergies, melting the ski-slopes and causing 22 deaths. 
                                However, according to an article in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, the 
                                damage it did was estimated at US$4 billion but the benefits amounted to some US$19 billion. 
                                These came from higher winter temperatures (which saved an estimated 850 lives, reduced 
                                heating costs and diminished spring floods caused by meltwaters).

                                The fourth factor is poor individual perception. People worry that the endless rise in the 
                                amount of stuff everyone throws away will cause the world to run out of places to dispose of 
                                waste, Yet, even if America’s trash output continues to rise as it has done in the past, and even 
                                if the American population doubles by 2100, all the rubbish America produces through the 
                                entire 21st century will still take up only one-12,000th of the area of the entire United States.

                                So what of global warming? As we know, carbon dioxide emissions are causing the planet to 
                                warm. The best estimates are that the temperatures will rise by 2—3°C in this century, 
                                causing considerable problems, at a total cost of US$5,000 billion.
                                
                                <br><br>
                                Despite the intuition that something drastic needs to be done about such a costly problem, 
                                economic analyses clearly show it will be far more expensive to cut carbon dioxide emissions 
                                radically than to pay the costs of adaptation to the increased temperatures. A model by one of 
                                the main authors of the United Nations Climate Change Panel shows how an expected 
                                temperature increase of 2.1 degrees in 2100 would only be diminished to an increase of 1.9 
                                degrees. Or to put it another way, the temperature increase that the planet would have 
                                experienced in 2094 would be postponed to 2100.

                                <br><br>
                                So this does not prevent global warming, but merely buys the world six years. Yet the cost of 
                                reducing carbon dioxide emissions, for the United States alone, will be higher than the cost of 
                                solving the world’s single, most pressing health problem: providing universal access to clean 
                                drinking water and sanitation. Such measures would avoid 2 million deaths every year, and 
                                prevent half a billion people from becoming seriously ill.

                                It is crucial that we look at the facts if we want to make the best possible decisions for the 
                                future. It may be costly to be overly optimistic — but more costly still to be too pessimistic.

                        many European countries as a landmark. According to his biographer, James Boswell, Johnson’s
